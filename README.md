## Installation
To use the AutoPilot EURUSD trading robot, you need to include the necessary libraries and functions. These include:
- Trade.mqh
- Timeseries.mqh
- Algorithm.mqh
- Utilities.mqh

## Input Parameters
The code includes several input parameters that can be modified to customize the trading settings. These parameters include:
- StopLoss: The stop loss target in pips.
- TradingTimes: The trading times in HH:MM-HH:MM format.
- EnableNewsFilter: A boolean value to enable or disable the news filter.

## Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is called to initialize the trading robot. In this function, the stop loss target, trading times, and news filter settings are set. Additionally, the symbol (EURUSD) and timeframe (PERIOD_H1) are set for the time series object. The algorithm is also initialized.

## Trading Operations
The `OnTick()` function is responsible for executing the trading operations. It first checks if it is within the trading times and if there are any news events. If both conditions are met, it retrieves the entry and exit prices from the algorithm. If the prices are valid, it executes the buy and sell trades using the trade object.

## Error Handling
The `OnError()` function is called whenever an error occurs. It prints the error code and can be customized to handle and log errors.

## Testing
The `OnTester()` function is used to backtest the algorithm using historical data. This function can be implemented to thoroughly test the code and evaluate its performance.

## Documentation
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the robot is stopped or removed from the chart. This function can be used to provide documentation and instructions for using the trading robot.
